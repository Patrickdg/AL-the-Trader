# AL-the-Trader

## Description 
Automated algorithmic stock paper-trading using daily triggers to simulate buy/sell transactions on specified watchlist. **Only intended for simulation and demonstration purposes, NOT for live trading.**  

Algorithm currently uses RSI (30, 70) bounds as (buy, sell) triggers for simplicity.  
Upcoming integrations will include DCF valuations, 50-200SMA, Bollinger bands, and MACD indicators.

Current watchlist tracks the 30 stocks in the DOW (as of May 1, 2020).

Scraping is performed using *yfinance* module and *pandas* to wrangle data into excel.
